# PHASE 4: QUOTATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

**Status:** Documentation Phase  
**Purpose:** Build a comprehensive quotation system that allows users to create, manage, and track quotations with advanced product search and pricing capabilities.

---

## Overview

Phase 4 introduces a complete quotation management system that leverages the enhanced product schema from Phase 3. The system enables users to search products efficiently, build detailed quotations with multiple line items, apply discounts, track quotation status, and generate professional PDF documents.

---

## Core Features

### 1. Quotation Creation and Management

- Create new quotations with customer information

- Automatically fetch product details (name, price, variants, compatibility)
- Handle complex product types (sets, variants, two-part systems)
- Display component breakdowns for sets
- Apply line-item level and overall discounts
- Calculate subtotals, tax, and grand totals
- Save quotations as drafts
- Edit existing quotations
- Delete quotations
- Duplicate quotations for similar customers

### 2. Advanced Product Search for Quotations

- **Flexible Partial Search**: Search by full or partial SKU, product name, or category
  - Example: SKU "S1053102" can be found by typing "S1", "053", or "3102"
  - Search matches anywhere in SKU, not just at the beginning
  - Case-insensitive search
- **Real-Time Suggestions**: Instant dropdown suggestions as user types
  - Show top 10 matching products
  - Display SKU, name, category, and price in suggestions
  - Keyboard navigation support (arrow keys, enter to select)
  - Highlight matching text in suggestions
- **Compatibility & Requirements Display**:
  - Show which systems/models the product works with
  - Display prerequisites (e.g., "Requires concealed part: XXX")
  - Show compatible accessories
  - Alert if product is part of a set
- **Variant Selection**:
  - Display available variants (colors, finishes) in search results
  - Quick variant selector in dropdown
  - Show price differences between variants
  - Display stock availability per variant
- **Category Filtering**: Filter by product categories from CSV imports
- **Product Structure Filtering**: Filter by standalone, set, variant, two-part
- **Smart Search Ranking**: Prioritize exact matches, then partial matches, then fuzzy matches
